                          jacksfilms (he doesn't capitalise his channel name) is known for comedy and parody videos, he has 4.97 subscribers on YouTube and 1.2 million followers on Twitter. He has a net worth of $2 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p>

                        SSSniperwolf has been creating content on YouTube for a decade, having pivoted from gaming to reaction videos, now known for reacting to TikTok clips. She has 24.5 million subscribers on YouTube and 5.5 million followers on Twitch. She also has a second channel, Little Lia, which has 4.5 million subscribers. She has a net worth of $8 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.
                      </p>
                    </div>

                        <div class="the-scoop-content-the story">
                            <h6 class="TS-story-title">What's the scoop?</h6>
                              <p>
                                jacksfilms has been highly critical of SSSniperwolf's reaction videos in the past. He has accused her of creating low-effort content by stealing ideas from TikTok creators, without proper credit or acknowledgment.
                              </p>
                                  
                              <p>
                                jacksfilms has made several videos on YouTube where he has called out SSSniperwolf, even going as far as to create a secondary YouTube channel titled “JJJacksfilms,” featuring 64 videos in which he criticizes and reacts to SSSniperwolf's reaction videos.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                The beef between them has been ongoing for quite some time but it all came to a head when SSniperwolf showed up to jacksfilms house and posted it on her public Instagram story, doxxing him and risking the safety of both himself and his wife.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                When jackfilms responded to this and called her out for doxxing him she simply stated on Twitter that "I have no idea how to Dox. He literally posted his address on Google and said I threatened him and doxxed him."
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                I think all of us can agree that this defence is hilariously rediculous. If you go and post where someone lives on the internet you're doxxing them, it's not rocket science and I strongly doubt that she has no idea what doxxing is when she has such a large platform herself.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                The fued continued with SSniperwolf 'joking' that she was      going to file a restraining order against jacksfilms because of all of the videos he makes about hers.jacksfilms was quick to point out the hipoccracy in this stating:
                              </p> 

                                <p class="the-scoop-quote-indent">
                                  “The 'harassing' you claim I've been doing is documenting recent examples of you stealing creators' content, stealing jokes, and failing to provide transformative commentary.”
                                </p>

                               <p>
                                Jack then pushed back against her “restraining order” comment by pointing out that “one of us showed up to the other's house tonight...and it wasn't me.”
                              </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="the-scoop-conclusion">
                          <p>
                            As usual, we're pretty opinionated over here at Bop or Flop and we have some thoughts on this whole situation. I think, categorically, there's no other takeaway from this whole situation other than the fact that SSniperwolf is <strong>clearly</strong> in her <strong>Flop era</strong> here. It's not a good look to doxx someone, especially when you have such a large platform and you know that your fans will do anything for you. It's dangerous and it's irresponsible. It feels awkwrd to say jacksfilms here is in his <strong>Bop era</strong> here, but the team here at Bop or Flop hope he is able to feel safe and comfortable in his own home going forth.

                    "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is the kind of movie that makes you wish you could go back in time, skip school, and embark on a day-long adventure of unparalleled mischief. The film is a classic teenage rebellion story, and it's safe to say Ferris Bueller is the hero we all wish we had the guts to be (and the principal we wish we could outsmart).

                    What elevates "Superbad" beyond the typical teen comedy is its keen understanding of the human experience beneath the layers of absurdity. Beneath the copious amounts of alcohol and teenage angst, there's a poignant exploration of friendship, self-discovery, and the bittersweet realization that high school, like all good things, must come to an end.</p>
